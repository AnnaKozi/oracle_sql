### If you need to find the mode (most frequent) IP address for each customer_id in your table_device_session, you can use a similar approach 
## but with an additional PARTITION BY clause in the ROW_NUMBER() window function to partition the data by id. Here's how you can do it:


    
SELECT 
customer_id, IP_ADDRESS, ip_count
FROM (
    SELECT id,
           IP_ADDRESS,
           COUNT(ip_address) AS ip_count,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY cid ORDER BY COUNT(IP_ADDRESS) DESC, SESSION_DATE desc) AS rn
    FROM your_table_device_session where IP_ADDRESS is not null
    GROUP BY cid, IP_ADDRESS,  SESSION_DATE
    ORDER BY id, COUNT(IP_ADDRESS) DESC
)
WHERE rn = 1;
