To perform a left join in Oracle SQL while also retrieving the minimum date from the joined table, you can use a subquery or a common table expression (CTE) to calculate the minimum date for each group in the joined table. Here's an example using a subquery:

sql
Copy code
SELECT t1.id, t1.name, t2.min_date
FROM table1 t1
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT id, MIN(date_column) AS min_date
    FROM table2
    GROUP BY id
) t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;
